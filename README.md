## Installation TL;DR

Setting up Pages CV on GitHub Pages is as simple as it gets!

[Fork](https://github.com/konzepts/pages-cv/fork) this repository, then rename the repository to `yourgithubusername.github.io`.

Your cv will then be viewable immediately at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if not, you can force a build by completing step 2).


## Installation
## Using Pages CV on GitHub Pages

Follow these steps if you already have GitHub Pages setup and enabled from the root pages repository.

### 1. Fork Pages CV to your User Repository

* [Fork](https://github.com/konzepts/pages-cv/fork) the repository
* Delete the `gh-pages` branch
* Re-create the `gh-pages` branch
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as main.
* Your new site should be ready at `https://username.github.io/pages-cv/`

Alternatively, click the [`Use this template`](https://github.com/konzepts/pages-cv/generate) button, if you want to create a repository with a clean commit history which will use Pages CV as a template.

You can also set the repository name to `cv` to have it served from `https://username.github.io/cv/`

Using the template option allows you to make the repository private and the CV will still be publicly accessible.


### 2. Customize and view your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the `index.html` file.

Making a change to `index.html` (or any file in your repository) will cause GitHub Pages to rebuild your site. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <https://username.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes per the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) suggests and it will be visable.
